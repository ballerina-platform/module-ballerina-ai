# Quick Start Guide

WSO2 Integrator: BI is a powerful low-code integration platform built on top of the <a href = "https://ballerina.io/">Ballerina programming language</a>. It’s designed to help developers quickly build, deploy, and manage integration solutions with minimal boilerplate and maximum productivity.

BI combines a visual design interface, AI-assisted development, and seamless low-code–to–pro-code transitions. With built-in connectors, flexible deployment options, and support for patterns like APIs, events, and automations, BI empowers teams to integrate faster and smarter.

Whether you’re modernizing legacy systems or building cloud-native services, BI provides a productive and scalable path to integration, helping teams drive digital transformation with clarity, speed, and confidence.

This quick start guide introduces five core integration types, each with a dedicated hands-on walkthrough.

## Automation

Create integrations that run on a timer—for example, to sync data, generate reports, or perform routine jobs. Follow [Develop your first automation](develop-automation.md) to get started.

## AI agent

Build agents that reason and act using GenAI models. Use them to respond to user input, access tools, or make decisions dynamically. Follow [Develop your first AI agent](develop-ai-agent.md) to get started. 

## Integrations as APIs

Expose your integration as a real-time API that handles incoming requests and returns results. Follow [Develop your first integration as API](develop-integration-as-api.md) to get started.

## Event Integration

Trigger your integration when messages arrive from sources like Kafka or RabbitMQ, enabling reactive workflows. Follow [Develop your first event integration](develop-event-integration.md) to get started.

## File Integration
 
Run your integration when files appear in a folder or FTP location—ideal for batch uploads or scheduled file processing. Follow [Develop your first file integration](develop-file-integration.md) to get started.
