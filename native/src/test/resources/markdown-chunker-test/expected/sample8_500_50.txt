This is a simple document without headers to test code block chunking.

Here's a Java code block:



--- Chunk 2 ---
Metadata: {"id": "6","index": "1","language": "java","type": "code_block"}
```java
public class SimpleClass {
    private String name;

    public SimpleClass(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```


--- Chunk 3 ---
Metadata: {"id": "7","index": "2"}

And here's a Python code block:



--- Chunk 4 ---
Metadata: {"id": "8","index": "3","language": "python","type": "code_block"}
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True

def main():
    hello_world()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```


--- Chunk 5 ---
Metadata: {"id": "9","index": "4"}

And a code block without language:



--- Chunk 6 ---
Metadata: {"id": "10","index": "5","language": "unknown","type": "code_block"}
```
This is a code block without language specification.
It should still be treated as a code block.
```


--- Chunk 7 ---
Metadata: {"id": "11","index": "6"}

This is the end of the document.
