--- Chunk 1 ---
This is a simple document without headers to test code block chunking.

Here's a Java code block:

```java
public class SimpleClass {
    private String name;

    public SimpleClass(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }

    public String getName() {
        return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
        this.name = name;
    }
}
```

And here's a Python code block:



--- Chunk 2 ---
```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True

def main():
    hello_world()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

And a code block without language:

```
This is a code block without language specification.
It should still be treated as a code block.
```

This is the end of the document.
