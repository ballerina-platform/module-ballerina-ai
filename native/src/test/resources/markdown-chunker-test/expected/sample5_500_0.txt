# Code Blocks and Horizontal Lines Test

This file tests the markdown chunker's ability to handle code blocks and horizontal lines as delimiters.

## Introduction

Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. This section should be chunked normally.

```javascript
function example() {
    console.log("This is a code block");
    return "testing code block delimiter";
}
```

After the code block, we continue with regular text. The chunker should split on the code block boundary.

--- Chunk 2 ---

## Section After Asterisk Horizontal Line

This section comes after a horizontal line made with asterisks. The chunker should recognize this as a delimiter.

```python
def another_function():
    print("Another code block")
    for i in range(10):
        print(f"Number: {i}")
```

More text after the Python code block.

## Section After Dash Horizontal Line  


--- Chunk 3 ---

This section follows a horizontal line made with dashes. This tests the dash delimiter pattern.

```java
public class TestClass {
    public void method() {
        System.out.println("Java code block");
    }
}
```

Text continues here.

## Section After Underscore Horizontal Line


--- Chunk 4 ---

This section follows a horizontal line made with underscores. Testing the underscore delimiter.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
echo "Shell script example"
ls -la
```

Final section with more content to ensure proper chunking behavior.

## Multiple Code Blocks

First code block:

```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE active = 1;
```

Some text between code blocks.

```xml
<configuration>
    <setting name="example" value="test"/>
</configuration>
```
