# Ballerina AI Agent Module Examples

## Overview

We provide a variety of examples to demonstrate how the Ballerina AI Agent module can assist you in building agents efficiently. These examples showcase different types of tools and their defining/loading capabilities, highlighting how each agent can be utilized.



### Simple Agent with Mock Tools

In this basic example, we demonstrate the fundamental usage of the Agent module with mock tools. You can find more details in the  [example documentation](/examples/mock-tools/README.md).

### Examples showcasing Efficient Tool Defining Capabilities

We have created three examples to showcase the enhanced loading API resource capabilities of the Agent module with different strategies for defining tools:

1. [Register API resources as Tools](/examples/function-as-tool/README.md) using function wrappers.
2. [Define API resources as HttpTool](/examples/http-toolkit/README.md) without the need for function wrappers, making it easier to work with.
3. [Load API resources from OpenAPI spec](/examples/load-from-openapi/README.md) directly with a single line of code.

### Example demonstrating the Utilization of Multiple Types of Tools

This example illustrates the Agent's ability to comprehend and interact with different types of tools, aided by toolkits. You can explore this example further in the [documentation].
